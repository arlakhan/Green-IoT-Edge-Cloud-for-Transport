AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) combined with Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM), Blockchain, Edge Computing, and Cloud Technologies is revolutionizing supply chain operations. AIoT integrates AI with IoT devices, enabling real-time data collection and analysis to enhance decision-making and efficiency. When applied to GSCM, this integration helps in reducing the carbon footprint by optimizing resource usage and minimizing waste through predictive analytics and automated processes.

Blockchain technology adds transparency and security by providing an immutable ledger for transactions, ensuring traceability and accountability across the supply chain. This is crucial for verifying sustainability claims and ethical sourcing.

Edge Computing complements this by processing data closer to where it is generated, reducing latency and improving real-time responsiveness. This is particularly useful for managing large volumes of data from IoT devices, enhancing operational efficiency and reliability.

Cloud Computing offers scalable storage and computational power, supporting the large-scale deployment of AI models and analytics tools. It facilitates collaboration and data sharing across various stakeholders in the supply chain, further optimizing operations and promoting sustainability.

Together, these technologies create a synergistic approach to managing supply chains that are more efficient, transparent, and environmentally friendly.
